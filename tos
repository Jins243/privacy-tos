# Terms of Service  

## Service Description
Hades' Star Manager is an inofficial Bot that manages HS-related data from webhook data streams.

## User Responsibilities
Users must not use the bot for malicious and illegal purposes, nor violate the discord Terms of Service. They may not use the bot to impersonate another player by linking their account to someone else's. Apart from that, any responsibilities are left to the admins of any server that installs HS Manager. We reserve the right to remove usage rights for any user or server if they violate these rules.

## Data Handling & Privacy Considerations
The Bot processes only publicly available data from Discord and data from each server's HS webhook. It cannot, however, verify that the data genuinely comes from the Hades' Star servers or was sent by someone else with access to the webhook. Only data regarding ingame information and discord user IDs are stored, the latter only in the case the user allows us to, by using the `/linkaccount` command. The stored discord ID can be removed at any time using the `/unlinkaccount` command.

## Intellectual Property
The Bot and its associated data are owned by CharismaticLeo. All users are granted a revokable license to view data for any server that gives them the permission for it, and to manage their own server's data.

## Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
No Warranty: The Bot is provided as is and as available, without warranties of any kind. We do not warrant that:
  1. The Bot will function uninterrupted, secure, or error-free
  2. The results obtained from using the Bot will be accurate or reliable
  3. Any issues with the Bot will be corrected
Data Accuracy & Availability: We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, or availability of data processed by the Bot.  
Limitation of Liability: In no event shall we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:  
  1. Your use, misuse or inability to use the bot
  2. Any unauthorized access to or use of our publicly accessible data
  3. Any falsified or incorrect data in any servers' records
  4. Any interruption, modification, or cessation of the bot's functionality
  5. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities affecting the bot

## Modifications to the Service and Terms 
We may modify these terms and the bot's functionality at any time. By using the bot you agree to these amendments.

## Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and our and their respective officers, directors, and employees, from any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, or fees arising from:  
  1. Your violation of these terms
  2. Your use of the bot
  3. Any disputes arising from data provided by third-party services (e.g., Discord, Hadesâ€™ Star, GitHub).
